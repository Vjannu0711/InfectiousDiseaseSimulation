# InfectiousDiseaseSimulation
With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the study of epidemiology and the modeling of infectious diseases has soared in over the past several months. Public health officials and medical practitioners and leaders are all looking for innovative ways to be one step ahead in the fight to end diseases. This project simulates an infectious disease and displays how a disease spreads and gets eradicated in a population. It uses the size of a population, the probabilities of individuals getting vaccinated and infected, as well as the number of days any individual is infected (severity of the disease) to model the spread and eventual eradication of a disease. The goal of this project is to ultimately show how taking certain steps like getting vaccinated can reduce the overall transmission of disease in a population and speed the process of ending the disease.
